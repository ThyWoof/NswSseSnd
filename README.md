# NswSseSnd
Converts FUZ, WAV, WMA and LIP formats from PC Skyrim SE to Nintendo Switch MCADPCM / FUZ formats

## Copyrights

- Uses DSP encoder at https://github.com/Thealexbarney/DspTool
- Uses Dr_Wav library at https://mackron.github.io/dr_wav

## Usage

This is a work in progress.

## Working so Far

Can only read WAV files and only output DSP ones (most likely dual channel isn't working as it should now)
